                <p>
                    2. Create or connect to a tube by sending <span>/spacetube</span> or{" "}
                    <span>/spacetube invite-code-here</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Start sending messages by sending <span>/spacetube your-message-here</span>
                </p>
                <p>Read on for the Rocketchat Specifics...</p>
                <span className="divider"></span>
                <h3 className="center">Install the Spacetube private app</h3>
                <p>
                    1.{" "}
                    <a href="https://github.com/King-Mob/spacetube-rocketchat/raw/refs/heads/main/published/spacetube_0.0.1.zip">
                        Download the plugin here
                    </a>
                    , or build it yourself by following the{" "}
                    <a href="https://github.com/King-Mob/spacetube-rocketchat">instructions on github</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. On Rocketchat go to Administration → Marketplace → Private Apps, click "Upload private app",
                    browse file for the plugin you just downloaded/built. Click Agree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Register your chat server with Spacetube. On the App Info page, under APIs, there's a url inside
                    a curl POST request, like in this picture:
                </p>

                <p>
                    {" "}
                    Copy just the url, and then in the general channel send /spacetube followed by the url you just
                    copied, like this:{" "}
                    <span>
                        /spacetube
                        https://rocketchat.wobbly.app/api/apps/public/c16853cf-c591-4453-b1dd-7def3e08cf02/forward
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p className="center">Once that's done, EITHER:</p>
                <h3 className="center">Connect to an existing tube</h3>
                <p>1. Copy the invite code you received from someone else.</p>
                <p>
                    2. Send /spacetube followed by the invite code you received to the room. It should look like{" "}
                    <span>/spacetube invite-code-here</span>
                </p>
                <p className="center">OR</p>
                <h3 className="center">Create a new tube</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Send <span>/spacetube</span> in a channel to make a new tube! Spacetube will make a new invite
                    code for you. You can customise your invite code by sending{" "}
                    <span>@/spacetube custom-invite-code-here</span> instead when you make the tube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Share the invite code with someone in the group you want to connect to. Now they need to do the
                    next part.
                </p>
                <p className="center">FINALLY</p>
                <h3 className="center">Send messages</h3>
                <p>
                    Send messages by sending <span>/spacetube what's up earthlings?</span> in the room and everything
                    after /spacetube will be forwarded to those in the tube.
                </p>
                <h2>Happy tubing!</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
